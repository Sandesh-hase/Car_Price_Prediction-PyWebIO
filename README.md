PyWebIO Intro:- 

PyWebIO provides a diverse set of imperative functions to obtain user input and output content on the browser, turning the browser into a “rich text terminal”, and can be used to build simple web applications or browser-based GUI applications. Using PyWebIO, developers can write applications just like writing terminal scripts (interaction based on input and print function), without the need to have knowledge of HTML and JS. PyWebIO is ideal for quickly building interactive applications that don’t require a complicated user interface.
